# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Version numbers are maintained in `duilib/duilib_version.h` in
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD` form; `BUILD` uses `MMDD` without a leading zero.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2026.1023] - 2026-10-23

### Added

- Release packaging script `build/pack.py`: collects already-built artifacts
  under the SDK contract and produces zip/tgz archives with `MANIFEST.txt`,
  `SHA256SUMS` and an in-package `VERSION`.
- Release orchestration script `build/release.py` with `check`, `package`,
  `finalize` and `clean`; it never performs git write operations.
- Integration layers inside the package: VS `msvc/nim_duilib.props`, `.targets`
  and x64/x86 manifests; CMake `lib/cmake/nim_duilib/*.cmake` providing
  `nim_duilib::duilib`.
- Top-level user documentation ships with the SDK, with Markdown links rewritten
  for the package layout.
- `--with-cef` now also packages the CEF runtime, keeping the
  `bin/libcef_win[_109]/<arch>/` layout (`libcef.dll`, `*.pak`, `icudtl.dat`,
  `locales/`, ...) on Windows.
- Release documentation: `docs/Release.md`, `docs/misc/Release-Checklist.md` and
  the packaging work record.

### Changed

- Version numbers are unified in `duilib/duilib_version.h`; `msvc/dllRes/version.h`
  is now an RC adapter.
- Resources moved to `bin/resources/`, next to the example programs.
- Package names gain feature suffixes: `-sdl`, `-cef` / `-cef109`, `-examples`,
  `-debug`, so packages of the same version can coexist under `dist/`.
- `docs/` ships only top-level user documentation; subdirectories such as
  `misc/` and `specs/` are not packaged.
- Archive semantics: tar entries use the source file permissions (executable and
  setuid bits preserved) and zip stores symbolic links as `S_IFLNK` entries, so
  Unix packages keep the `.so` link chain and executable permissions after
  extraction; symbolic links are no longer listed in `SHA256SUMS`.

### Fixed

- Fixed the macOS build failure caused by the root `VERSION` file clashing with
  the standard `<version>` header.
- The SDK integration layers (VS property sheet and CMake config) now add
  `/NODEFAULTLIB:"libcmt.lib"` for Debug builds, removing the downstream
  LNK4098 warning.

### Removed

- Removed the root `VERSION.txt` to avoid a second source of version data.
